##Capstone Project Ideas##

###1. Facebook V: Predicting Check Ins (Hiring Challenge)###

**Question:** Identify the correct place for check ins.

**Datasets:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins/data

**Task Description:**
The goal of this competition is to predict which place a person would like to check in to. For the purposes of this competition, Facebook created an artificial world consisting of more than 100,000 places located in a 10 km by 10 km square. For a given set of coordinates, your task is to return a ranked list of the most likely places. Data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices, giving you a flavor of what it takes to work with real data complicated by inaccurate and noisy values. Inconsistent and erroneous location data can disrupt experience for services like Facebook Check In.

###2. Expedia Hotel Recommendations###
**Question:** Which hotel type will an Expedia customer book?####

**Datasets:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations

**Task Description:**
Expedia has provided you logs of customer behavior. These include what customers searched for, how they interacted with search results (click/book), whether or not the search result was a travel package. The data in this competition is a random selection from Expedia and is not representative of the overall statistics.

Expedia is interested in predicting which hotel group a user is going to book. Expedia has in-house algorithms to form hotel clusters, where similar hotels for a search (based on historical price, customer star ratings, geographical locations relative to city center, etc) are grouped together. These hotel clusters serve as good identifiers to which types of hotels people are going to book, while avoiding outliers such as new hotels that don't have historical data.

Your goal of this competition is to predict the booking outcome (hotel cluster) for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event.

###3. Relate World Bank Development Indicators and Global Average Land Temperature by Country###
**Question:** Is there a direct co-relation between development indicators and Average Land temperatures?

**Datasets:**

1. https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators
2. https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

**Description:**
The World Bank Development Indicators Dataset includes various indicators such as CO2 emission, Export Volume, Per-Capita Energy Use, GDP, e.t.c. Likewise the Berkeley Earth Dataset contains average land temperatures measured over the past three centuries. The goal of this exercise is to relate the two datasets and understand if there are any positive or negative correlations between the aformentioned indicators and average land temperatures over the past decade. Particularly, we'd like to test the hypothesis that Industrialization lead to a direct increase in Global temperatures and test this hypothesis through the data in the dataset.
